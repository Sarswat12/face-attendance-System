  FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM - SIMPLE PROJECT SUMMARY
==========================================================================

PROJECT NAME: Face Recognition Attendance System
FRONTEND TECHNOLOGY: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
BACKEND REQUIRED: Flask (Python) with Face Recognition ML

===========================================================================
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
===========================================================================

A web application that automatically marks attendance using facial recognition.
Instead of manual sign-in sheets or ID cards, users register their face once,
and the system recognizes them automatically.

WHO USES IT:
  1. Employees - Mark attendance, view their attendance history
  2. Admin - View all attendance records, manage users and reports

===========================================================================
WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED?
===========================================================================

FRONTEND (This folder):
  - React 18.3.1 (JavaScript library for building UI)
  - Vite 6.3.5 (Fast build tool and dev server)

  - Radix UI (Pre-made components like buttons, dialogs, etc)
  - Lucide Icons (300+ icons for UI)
  - React Hook Form (Managing form data)
  - Motion/Framer Motion (Animations)
  - Recharts (Charts and graphs)

BACKEND (REQUIRED - Not in this folder):
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - face_recognition library (Extract faces from images)
  - dlib (Face detection and encoding)
  - OpenCV (Image processing)
  - MySQL (Database)
  - Python ML libraries (numpy, scipy)

DATABASE (REQUIRED):
  - MySQL database for storing:
    * User accounts

DATA REQUIREMENTS - WHAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE STORED?
===========================================================================

USER INFORMATION:
  - Name, Email, Password
  - Role (Admin/Employee)
  - Department, Phone, Address
  - Join Date, Status (Active/Inactive)

FACE DATA:
  - Face encodings (128-dimensional vector - ML generated)

===========================================================================
HOW DOES IT WORK? - STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
===========================================================================

STEP 1: USER REGISTRATION
  1. New user goes to LoginPage
  2. Clicks "Register" tab
  3. Fills in: Name, Email, Password, Role (Employee)
  4. Frontend sends data to Backend: POST /api/auth/register
  5. Backend creates user in MySQL database
  6. User gets login token

STEP 2: FACE REGISTRATION
  1. User logs in → sees Dashboard
  2. Clicks "Register Face" option
  3. Captures 5-7 photos (using computer camera or uploaded images)
  4. Clicks "Submit for Training"
  5. Frontend sends images to Backend: POST /api/faces/register
  6. Backend extracts face from each image
  7. Backend generates face encoding (128-D vector) using face_recognition
  8. Backend stores encoding in database
  9. Backend stores original images on disk

STEP 3: MARK ATTENDANCE
  1. Employee goes to AttendancePage
  2. Clicks "Start Recognition"
  3. Camera captures user's face
  4. Image sent to Backend: POST /api/attendance/mark
  5. Backend extracts face from image
  6. Backend compares with all stored face encodings
  7. Backend finds best match (if confidence > threshold)
  8. Backend creates attendance record
  9. Frontend shows "Attendance Marked" message

STEP 4: VIEW ATTENDANCE (ADMIN)
  1. Admin logs in → sees AdminDashboard
  2. Can filter by date, month, year, department
  3. Frontend requests: GET /api/attendance/records?filters...
  4. Backend returns filtered records
  5. Admin can export to CSV or PDF

===========================================================================
FILE PATHS AND KEY LOCATIONS
===========================================================================

FRONTEND FILES TO MODIFY FOR BACKEND:
  - LoginPage.jsx (POST /api/auth/login)
  - Dashboard.jsx (GET /api/statistics/dashboard)
  - AdminUserManagement.jsx (GET /api/users, POST/PUT/DELETE)

===========================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES FOR BACKEND TEAM
===========================================================================

1. RESPONSE FORMAT
   - Always return JSON
   - Include 'message' field
   - For lists, include 'total', 'present', 'absent' counts
   - For errors, include error code and details

2. AUTHENTICATION
   - Use JWT tokens (JSON Web Tokens)
   - Token in header: Authorization: Bearer {token}
   - Token should expire after 7 days (configurable)
   - Refresh token endpoint recommended

3. FILE UPLOADS
   - Accept multipart/form-data
   - Validate file types (only JPEG, PNG)
   - Validate file sizes (max 5MB)
   - Save with unique names (include timestamp, user_id)
   - Return URL where file is accessible

4. FACE RECOGNITION
   - Use distance threshold of 0.6 (tunable)
   - Return confidence score (0-1)
   - Store encodings as BLOB in database
   - Allow re-registration of faces (update encodings)

5. PERFORMANCE
   - Index database on: user_id, timestamp, email
   - Use pagination for large queries (limit 50 per page)
   - Cache user encodings in memory for fast lookup
   - Consider async processing for image encoding

6. ERROR HANDLING
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - 200 = Success
   - 201 = Created
   - 400 = Bad request
   - 401 = Unauthorized
   - 403 = Forbidden
   - 404 = Not found
   - 500 = Server error
